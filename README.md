Here you can see the "scripts" node of package.json. You can see here if you need to use the Node.JS interpreter, you have to include it ('node' before the script name, considering that 'node' can be find through the PATH):

If you have to do more than 1 task in a script, you can concatenate the comands with "&&" (as in "myScript" line in the previous image) or make a script that do ths two things.

Here you can see some common script names. Note the use of double column in some script names:

Teacher explained that there is not an universal rule of naming conventions. But he suggested:

- to group the scripts by context using prefixes like "test:" or "start:";
